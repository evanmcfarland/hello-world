# hello-world

Test Run Repository
This is my first github interaction and is used to create and use a repository, start and manage branches, 
make changes to a file, push as a github commit, and open and merge a pull request. 

Hello humans. The remainder of this code comes from a secondary branch that is updated to the master copy. Here is my practice run at generating commits in branched file and a little bit about myself. 

I like long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners. 
My top hobbies are yoga, meditation, and drawing statistical insights from data analysis. 
My education is in Facilities Engineering but I am really looking for a career in data analytics. 
Thank you to the github community for the wonderful and free functionality that is offered here. 
I hope to be an active contributor by providing public code for all the personal projects I am working on.
