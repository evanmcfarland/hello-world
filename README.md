# hello-world

Hello humans. Here is my practice run at generating commits in branched files. Heres a little bit about myself. 

I like long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners. 
My top hobbies are yoga, meditation, and drawing statistical insights from data analysis. 
My education is in Facilities Engineering but I am really looking for a career in data analytics. 
Thank you to the github community for the wonderful and free functionality that is offered here. 
I hope to be an active contributor by providing public code for all the personal projects I am working on.
